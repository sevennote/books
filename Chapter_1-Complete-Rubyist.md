| Operations| Example(s)  | Comments |
| print     |print "Hello"| puts adds a newline to the string it outpus if there isn't one at the end already; print doesn't. Print prints exctly what it's told to and leaves the cursor at the end. (Note: On some platforms, an extra line is automatically output at the end of a program.) p outputs an inspect string, *which may contain extra information about what it's printing*. |
